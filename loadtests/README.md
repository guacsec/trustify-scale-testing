# trustify loadtest

A set of simple [goose](https://book.goose.rs/) load tests against the web and rest endpoints.

## quickstart

1. Ensure trustify is running.

2. Set environment variables for OIDC authentication:
   ```bash
   export ISSUER_URL = "http://localhost:8090/realms/trustify"
   export CLIENT_ID =  "testing-user"
   export CLIENT_SECRET = "****************"
   ```

   To change wait times between http invokes set the following env vars:

   ```bash
   export WAIT_TIME_FROM = 1
   export WAIT_TIME_TO =  2
   ```

   Alternately, for no wait times between http invokes set these env vars to 0.

3. To load trustify endpoints with 3 concurrent users.
   ```bash
   cargo run --release --bin loadtest -- --host http://localhost:8080 -u 3
   ```

   To stop load test hit [ctl-C], which should generate aggregate statistics.

   To load trustify endpoints against 10 concurrent users, generating an html report.

   ```bash
   cargo run --release -- --host http://localhost:8080  --report-file=report.html --no-reset-metrics -u 10
   ```
